							This was been my most ambitious and best game to date. I was looking for a role playing game to play and I realized that very few games had anything besides combat. So I set out to make a game that didn't have any combat at all. Sidelined is a strategy game where your goal is to collect and research all 21 items that are available in your world. It is a simple game for anyone to learn how to play. Once you beat the game, your adventure is not over. You need to learn from your mistakes to try to complete the mission faster the next time to beat your score.
