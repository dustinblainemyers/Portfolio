						<h6 class="award-line">IEEE-GameSig 2016 Finalist</h6>
						<p>
							This was been my most ambitious and best game to date. I was looking for a role playing game to play and I realized that very few games had anything besides combat. So I set out to make a game that didn't have any combat at all. Sidelined is a strategy game where your goal is to collect and research all 21 items that are available in your world. It is a simple game for anyone to learn how to play. Once you beat the game, your adventure is not over. You need to learn from your mistakes to try to complete the mission faster the next time to beat your score.

						<h6 class="award-line">1st place - 2015 College Game Design Competition</h6>
						<p>
							A twist on the classic platformer. Now with puzzles! You must explore the level with your robot jumping between the floating platforms to find your way to the goal. But wait, there's more! There will be some platforms that you cannot reach by yourself. You will need to pick up and move blocks to help you reach new areas. This game was created for a Single Level Platformer competition and as such, it only has one level. But when you beat it, there are instructions for a level editor to make your own one-level platformer puzzle.

						<p>
							Word Search is exactly what it sounds like. You are given a grid of letters and a word that you need to find within those random letters. There is a lot of variety to this game so you probably won't ever get the same puzzle again.

						<h2 class="game-title">The Quest: Patinor</h2>
						<p>
							This is my first game coded in C++. It is a text RPG (Role Playing Game). You are an adventurer that finds himself in the Land of Patinor. The village that you wake up in is constantly being attacked by a mighty dragon. You must take on the challenge of slaying the dragon and saving the village. For anyone who plays RPG games, there won't be much of a learning curve for this game. The thing that sets it apart from most other games of this genre is that it is all text. That gives this game a retro feel. To control the game, you type in the action instead of clicking on a button. It really makes you feel like you're in the adventure.

						<h2 class="game-title">Money Dice</h2>
						<p>
							This is a 100% original dice game. Normally dice games are really random and the player has little control over their own success. I wanted to make a game where you roll dice but there is still a lot of strategy involved. You earn money by rolling dice and can use that money to buy more dice, each with their own unique properties. Try to beat the computer by getting the higher score. (Java)

						<h2 class="game-title">Gopher Smash</h2>
						<p>
							This is my take on the classic Wack-a-Mole game. In Gopher Smash, you play a farmer driving a tractor to smash the gophers as they pop up out of their holes. There are 10 levels which get progressively more difficult. Once you beat all 10 then you unlock endless mode and you can compete for the highest score. (Java)

						<p>
							Rat Race is a simple maze game. You are a rat and you have to collect all of the cheese to complete the maze. The best part of this game is that you will never run out of mazes. Every single maze you play is generated right before your eyes. If you like mazes or puzzle games, you will definitely enjoy playing Rat Race. (Java)

						<p>
							I started this game in 2013, but I gave up on the game because I realized I had no clue how to make it. A year later, I remembered the idea and finished the project. This was so much fun to do, because I realized how far I'd come in less than a year. Intersection is a game where you are in control of an intersection. Clever name, right? You control when the cars go and while doing so, you have to avoid causing accidents or upsetting the drivers by making them wait too long. (Java)

						<p>
							I wanted to make an easy-to-use, real-time stock market simulator so that people can play around with buying and selling stocks from the real stock market but without the risk of losing real money. This program only includes the 30 Dow stocks so it is a lot easier to keep track of your money. It is a great way to learn the stock market or try out new strategies. And, of course, it's fun if you enjoy financial things. (Java)

						<p>
							This was my first attempt at making more than just a little mini game. It was a long and stressful journey but I have had good feedback on it so I guess everything turned out the way it was supposed to. Asteroids is a top down space shooter. You are stranded in space and must defend against asteroids. You complete missions to earn experience and level up your pilot to unlock new technology. You might even find some cool things in space along the way. (Java)

							This game is my pride and joy. I wanted to create my own game in the new genre of idle games. This was my biggest project to date. The goal of the game is to earn bytes, which are units of computer data. To do so, you can manually press the space bar to accumulate bytes or you can buy equipment which will earn you bytes automatically. It may seem simple, which it is, but it's also really addicting.
